1. We will first spec out the requirements of the OS and its use case.
    a) May take future steps into account to design for upgradability.

2. Spec out requirements for programming language from OS reqs.

3. Write lexical analyser and parser to understand language.

4. Define an assembly language (ISA) that can support the language.

5. Build compiler that uses lexical analyser and parser to convert programming language to assembly

6. Design CPU to support ISA

7. Implement Assembler

8. Run some programs on it 

9. Implement OS
